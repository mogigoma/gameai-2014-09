        <div class="span12">
          <h3>SkullWhist</h3>

	  <p>The game for this event is <em>SkullWhist</em>, a heavily
          modified form
          of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_whist">Bid
          Whist</a>. It has been modified to be quicker (one round),
          simpler (static trump suit, no kitty), and two-player (not
          four). The name SkullWhist was chosen due to its
          undisputable awfulness.</p>

          <p>To start a game, both bots must trigger
          the <strong><a href="/api/new-game/">new-game</a></strong> endpoint. Once two bots are
          matched, both will be given a hand consisting of 13 random cards from
          a standard 52-card deck, and the remaining cards will be thrown
          out. Each card has a suit, which is one of:</p>

	  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
	    <dt>C</dt>
	    <dd>Clubs</dd>
	    <dt>D</dt>
	    <dd>Diamonds</dd>
	    <dt>H</dt>
	    <dd>Hearts</dd>
	    <dt>S</dt>
	    <dd>Spades</dd>
	  </dl>

	  <p>In addition, each card will have a value between 1 and 13,
	    inclusive. Using integers helps avoid the need to add conversion
	    logic between face cards and integer values in the bots.</p>

	  <p>Once each bot has been given their hand of cards for the game, they
	    must submit a bid to the server using
	    the <strong><a href="/api/bid/">bid</a></strong> endpoint. The bid must be an integer
	    between 1 and 13, inclusive, and represents the number of rounds
	    (also called <em>tricks</em>) the bot thinks it can win based on the
	    cards in its hand. Once bidding has completed, play begins.</p>

	  <p>Each round consists of two turns, one for each bot. In the first
	    round, the order of the turns is chosen randomly, and is indicated
	    to the bot by the
	    <code>your-turn</code> key returned by
	    the <strong><a href="/api/status/">status</a></strong> endpoint. The bot that leads
	    the round, meaning having the first turn, may choose to play any
	    card in its hand. If the bot instead has the second turn in the
	    round, it is restricted in the card it may play. The card played in
	    the first turn of a round determines the suit for the round, and the
	    bot with the second turn must play a card matching that suit if it
	    has any cards of that suit remaining in its hand. If the bot with
	    the second turn has no cards matching the suit of the card played in
	    the first turn, it may choose to play any card in its hand.</p>

	  <p>Once both turns have been taken, and both cards have been played,
	    for a round, the server determines the winner of the round and
	    awards a trick to one of the two bots, and grants the winning bot
	    the lead turn on the next round. The winner of a round is determined
	    as follows:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>If the cards both had the same suit, the card with the greatest
	    value wins</li>
	    <li>If the cards had different suits:
	      <ul>
		<li>If the second card's suit was Spades, the second card
		wins</li>
		<li>Otherwise, the first card wins</li>
	    </ul></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>The rules for awarding a trick are complicated by Spades being the
	    trump suit, which gives any card in the suit of Spades the following
	    properties:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>When comparing a card in the suit of Spades to a card of another
	      suit, the card in the Suit of spades wins</li>
	    <li>When comparing two cards in the suit of Spades, the card with
	      the greatest value wins</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Once 13 rounds have been played, the server will score the
	    game. Scoring gives great weight to the accuracy of each bot's bid
	    when compared to the tricks it has been awarded. The score for each
	    bot is calculated as follows:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>If the number of tricks matches the bid:
	      <ul><li><code>score = bid * +10</code></li></ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>If the number of tricks is less than the bid:
	      <ul><li><code>score = bid * -10</code> <strong>negative</strong></li></ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>If the number of tricks is greater than the bid:
	      <ul><li><code>score = (bid * +10) + (tricks - bid)</code></li></ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Seeing the rules written out like this is more difficult to understand than an
	    example, so here are some:</p>

<pre>1) This shows that a bot with more accurate bidding logic can match the
   score of a bot with smarter playing logic:

   Bot 1 had bid = 1 and tricks = 11
   --> score = (1 * +10) + (11 - 1) = 10 + 10 = 20

   Bot 2 had bid = 2 and tricks = 2
   --> score = (2 * +10) = 20

2) This shows that when two bots both play it safe on bidding, the bot with
   the smarter playing logic will win:

   Bot 1 had bid = 1 and tricks = 7
   --> score = (1 * +10) + (7 - 1) = 10 + 6 = 16

   Bot 2 had bid = 1 and tricks = 6
   --> score = (1 * +10) + (6 - 1) = 10 + 5 = 15

3) This shows that when two bots both fail to make their bid, they both
   receive negative scores. As scores are compared numerically, Bot 2 would
   win by virtue of its lower bid:

   Bot 1 had bid = 8 and tricks = 7
   --> score = (8 * -10) = -80

   Bot 2 had bid = 5 and tricks = 6
   --> score = (5 * -10) = -50</pre>

<p>The number of tricks awarded to each player in any completed game will add up to
  13, the number of rounds.</p>

<p>After scoring has completed, both bots will be released from their game by the
server, and will be free to call the <strong><a href="/status/new-game/">new-game</a></strong> endpoint again. Unlike regular
Bid Whist which accumulates scores across multiple rounds, ending when one
player has reached a certain score threshold, each game of SkullWhist consists
of a single, independent round.</p>

	  <p>This game has 13 decisions in it. The decisions are as follows:</p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>What number of tricks to bid, from 1-13</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  1, from 13 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  2, from 12 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  3, from 11 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  4, from 10 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  5, from  9 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  6, from  8 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  7, from  7 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  8, from  6 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round  9, from  5 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round 10, from  4 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round 11, from  3 options</li>
	    <li>Which card to play in round 12, from  2 options</li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>In round 13, only one card is left, and therefore the bot has no
	    choice in which card is played. Currently, the example bots all
	    choose randomly from the set of all the valid choices allowed,
	    leading to any two example bots to each win about half the time in
	    our server burn-in tests.</p>

	  <p>There are two main facets of the AI for a bot: bidding and playing.</p>

	  <p>The bidding algorithm gets to make choice 1. Careful bidding is
	    important as tricks awarded that are within the value of the bid are
	    worth ten times more than extra tricks above the bid, and bidding
	    too high is catastrophic, especially in this single-round version of
	    the game.</p>

	  <p>The playing algorithm gets to make choices
	    2-13. The <strong><a href="http://gameai.skullspace.ca/api/status/">status</a></strong>
	    endpoint offers both the opponent's ID and its bid for this round,
	    which can be used to tailor your bot's strategy. The opponent's bid
	    is made available to you only after your bot has bid.</p>

<p>
Some things to think about when designing your AI, in no particular order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Does the bid your opponent makes tell you anything about the cards it has?
      For example: The number of trump, or the number of cards above 10, or something else?
</li>
<li>
    You know your opponent has 13 cards out of 52, and you also know what your
      13 cards are, so you have some idea of what they can and cannot have in
      their hand to start.
</li>
<li>
    When an opponent plays an off-suit card in the second turn, you know that
      they no longer have any cards in the suit of the card played in the first
      turn.
</li>
<li>When you have the opportunity to play an off-suit card, consider whether
      you want to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
      Play one of your trump cards
</li>
<li>
      Play a card that has no current strategic value
</li>
<ul>
<li>
        A card in a suit you know the opponent no longer has, and can
          therefore be trumped by them
</li>
<li>
        A low-value card in a suit you know your opponent still has but will
          reduce the number of cards you have in that suit, so you can trump in
          that suit sooner.
</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<p>
One endpoint that is not used by the example bots is
<strong><a href="http://gameai.skullspace.ca/api/old-game/">old-game</a></strong>, which lets you
look up all the information related to a game once it is over. This information
includes the starting hands dealt to each player, the bids, the tricks, the
scores, and the events of each round. You may also find the statistics and
records pages on the website useful, especially notable are the 'versus'
comparisons between bots if you are looking to make your AI opponent-specific.
</p>
<p>
That's all I have to say about your AI right now, other than a suggestion to
retain the basic interaction model provided in the example bots.
</p>
<p>
If another endpoint is needed to implement something for your bot, ask me (Mak)
on IRC and I'll consider it if I have time.
